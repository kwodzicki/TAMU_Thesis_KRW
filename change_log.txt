Modified 15 May 2018 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Changed loading of natbib package to be an option of the class.
  If natbib was loaded and not required for the bibliography style,
  an error was produced on compile. Thus, if one needs natbib for their
  citation style, they just have to add the natbib option in the
  \documentclass{} command.


Modified 11 May 2018 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Updated to ensure matches the Spring 2018 LaTeX Template


Modified 18 Jan. 2018 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Updated some spacing in the ToC and around figures
  to better match the  v3.17.09 version
  Also added ability to place reference section
  at end of each chapter using the bibunits
  package. This added the 'chapref' option
  to the class


Modified 06 May 2017 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Updated the spacing in the TOCLOTF so that the spacing matched the
  TAMU LaTeX (Jan2017) template. Updated section number depth for
  TOC


Modified 14 Dec. 2016 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Replaced \baselineskip commands with the \singleSpace command


Modified 30 Nov. 2016 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Changed the construction of the committee from a tabular set up to
  minipages. Changed user input fields such as \Title and \FullName from
  commands to tokens. Not sure exactly how they work, but they make if
  statements much easier to work with and allows for changing of spacings
  much easier. This makes the code for and auto-spacing of the title page
  much cleaner.
  Redefine \chapter command to make chapters all upper case.
  Redefine \makeToC command to contain the options in the deprecated 
  'Chapter' command responsible for setting up page numbering in main
  text of thesis.
  Changed \makenomencalture command to \makeNomenclature


Modified 07 Nov. 2016 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Changed the \Chapter command definition by removing the \uppercase{}
  command that was contained in it and moving the uppercase option
  into the \titleformat{} command. The \titleformat{} command in the 
  re-defined appendices environment was also updated to reflect the
  change. This change was performed to remove a waring produced by
  the hyperref package that was due to the use of the \uppercase{}
  command within the \chapter{} command.


Modified 04 Nov. 2016 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Modified the appendices environment to remove extraneous files. 
  These files included and `appendices.tex' file that subsequently
  referenced `appendix1.tex' and `appendix2.tex'. By redefining the
  appendices class to include the default behavior and a changed title,
  now the `appendix1.tex' and `appendix2.tex' files can be included
  directly from the main .tex file AS LONG AS they are within the
  appendices environment.


Modified 03 Nov. 2016 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Changed the spacing in the table on contents section to fix an issue.
  There is now only a before chapter skip and the \perto command from the
  etoolbox package is used to add a space before the first section of a
  chapter.


Modified 31 Oct. 2016 by Kyle R. Wodzicki
----------------------------------------
  Added 'times' package requirement
  Changed title page 'Major Dept:' to 'Major Subject:'
  Rearranged and optimized formatting of ToC, LoF, and LoT
  Fixed spacings to better match that of Sean Zachary Roberson's V3.16.10 
  release. To the best of my knowledge, this class file should meet the
  requirements outlined by the 2016 Thesis Manual. This class file has NOT
  been thoroughly tested!!! DOCUMENT ALL CHANGES!!!!
