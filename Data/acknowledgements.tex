\begin{acknowledgements}

This section is also optional, limited to four pages. It must follow the Dedication Page (or Abstract, if no Dedication). If listing preliminary pages in Table of Contents, include Acknowledgments. Heading (\MakeUppercase{Acknowledgments}) is bold if major headings are bold. It should be in same type size and style as text. So does vertical spacing, paragraph style, and margins. Also, ensure that the spelling of ``acknowledgments'' matches throughout the text and the table of contents.
