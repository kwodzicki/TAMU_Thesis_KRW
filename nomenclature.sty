% Name:
%   nomenclature.sty
% Purpose:
%   A LaTeX style file used to format and define acronyms. Use the `short = ' 
%   and `long = ' options when declaring new acronyms to define how they will 
%   appear in text, with the acronym appearing as `long (short)' in the first
%   use and as `short' on all subsequent uses. The `list = ' option can also be 
%   used when defining acronyms. This will set how the acronym appears in the 
%   `Nomenclature' section. If the `list = ' option is NOT used, the
%   value in `long = ' will be displayed in the `Nomenclauture' section.
%   
%   If page numbers appear in the `Nomenclature' section, add the `nopage' option
%   to the package call. This was added because ShareLaTeX did not like page-style.
