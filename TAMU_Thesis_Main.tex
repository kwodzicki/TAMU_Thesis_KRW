%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The tamu_thesis class has the following options:
%   11pt or 12pt - This sets the size of the 
%      text for the document. Use 12pt unless
%      you have approval from OGAPS to use
%      11pt.
%   thesis - Add this option to set document type to Thesis.
%             Default is Dissertation
%   phd    - Add this option to set degree to DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY.
%             Defuault is MASTER OF SCIENCE
%   onehalfspacing - Changes spacing to 1.5
%      spacing. The default is to use double
%      spacing. Do NOT use this option unless
%      you have approval from OGPAS.
%   arial - Changes the font of the document to
%      Arial. The default font is Times New Roman.
%   binding - Changes the left margin to be 1.4
%      inches for binding purposes (recommended
%      in the thesis manual). The default is to
%      use 1 inch margins on all sides.
%   chapref - Will generate a references section
%      for each chapter of the document. The
%      default is to have  References chapter
%      after the main chapters of the document.
%   natbib - Will load the natbib package that is
%      required for some bibliography styles. If
%      you don't know what natbib is, you probably
%      don't need it.
%   draft - Enables draft mode. This will speed up
%     compiling of document by disabling hyper-
%     references and inserting wire frames where
%     images/figures should be.
%   acroall - Enables display of all nomenclature
%     (acronyms) defined in the nomenclature.tex 
%      file. Default is to display only those 
%      acronyms that have been used in an \ac{}
%      command.
%   acrohover - Enable full acronym definition 
%      pop-ups when hovering over an acronym in the 
%      text. Default is to NOT show full definition
%      when hovering. May not work in Preview on Mac.
